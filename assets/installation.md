## Installation

### Clone the project

`git clone git@github.com:imrhlrvndrn/create_project_python.git`

### Local installations & setup

1. Change directory into the root folder
2. Then setup the virtual env for the python project by running the command `python3 -m venv env`
3. The above command will create a folder named `env`
4. After creating virtual env, we'll now activate the env by running the command `source ./env/bin/activate` from the root directory
5. Now we'll install the required packages in this virtual env to avoid package version clashes with other python projects
6. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install third-party packages
